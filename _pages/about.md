I am an undergraduate student passionate about harnessing deep learning techniques to advance computer vision, with a particular focus on assistive technologies and medical applications. My academic journey is driven by the belief that technology should enhance human capabilities while ensuring accessibility for all.

## Academic Background  
Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in **Honors Program** at **VNU University of Science** (GPA: 3.91/4.0), I build upon my formal education by taking online courses from Harvard, Stanford, and Coursera. My academic foundation spans theoretical subjects such as calculus, linear algebra, and programming, along with practical applications in computer vision and machine learning.

## Research Interests  
My research interests lie at the intersection of:  
- Computer Vision & Medical Image Processing  
- Deep Learning & Computational Neuroscience

Through my work with the AIVN Research Group, I've gained hands-on experience in processing fMRI images and conducting literature reviews on medical imaging. This experience has reinforced my interest in developing intuitive, adaptive interfaces that respond to neural signals and physiological changes.

## Technical Projects  
<!-- I've led several projects that demonstrate my technical capabilities:  
- Implemented stereo matching algorithms for 3D depth reconstruction  
- Built image retrieval systems using CLIP embeddings and semantic search  
- Developed pathfinding visualizations using various algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*, Q-Learning)  
- Created optimized game engines with AI components   -->

## Community Involvement  
Active in the tech community as:  
- Community Member at **AI VIET NAM**  
- Research Member at **AIVN Research Group**  

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations or share insights about the fascinating intersection of AI and Computer Vision!
